# Dec_2019_CodeChallenge


This repo is dedicated for all the #coders who are participating in the Code Challenge.

#Update:
##Challenge 1: 
NLP + ML [High Difficulty]

Your Input is a 1000 words/prose. Your output should be a array of {Questions + Answers}. Use NLP to generate question from the given prose input. Just think Comprehensive Questioning but in Reverse!

##Challenge 2: 
NLP [Low Difficulty]

Your Input is a sentence/command. Your output should be a response for the sentence/command. You can use any language, library. But my recommendation is to Use Python + Rasa NLP to generate absolutely original chat client/app.
